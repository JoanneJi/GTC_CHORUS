# Abstract
Precise radial velocity (RV) surveys are trying to find Earth 2.0 in the next decade, which requires extremely high resolution spectrographs. We carry out simulations to compare two instrumental designs of CHORUS, the Canarian Hybrid Optical high-Resolution Ultra-stable Spectrograph, which will be installed on the Gran Telescopio de Canarias in 2027. CHORUS is under construction by NAOC and NIAOT in China, and it is expected to reach a RV precision of lower than 10cm/s in visible band. The two different designs differ primarily in the number of pupil slicing (3 vs. 2) and spectral resolution (120,000 vs. 95,000). We found  that the RV precision obtained under the 3-slice setting is better than the 2-slice setting, as expected, and the 3-slice setup would reach the instrument target of 10 cm/s precision at a more reasonable SNR. We used Kurucz’s solar template to synthesize observational spectra with input Doppler shift and various SNRs.  Then we extracted RVs using the cross-correlation method. We will carry out further simulations to test other aspects in the instrumental designs of CHORUS, and our work could help assessing the photon-limited RV precision and performances of other similar instruments. ![Uploading image.png…]()
